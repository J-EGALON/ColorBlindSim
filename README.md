# ColorBlindSim
A colorblind rendering tool for windows 7,8.1,10 users

My first project on github.
A windows form project embedding screenshots. You apply in the frame content several colorblind filters to the screenshot.
A alignment tool allows you to offset the screenshot due to the window fomr borders.
